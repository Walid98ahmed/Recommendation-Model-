Recommendation Model Using Cosine_Similarity and CountVectorizer: Scikit-Learn
Similarity analysis is a common task in Natural Language Processing(NLP)
 YouTube or Netflix use similar techniques to recommend to their customers. They analyze the previous behavior of their customers and based on that, 
 they recommend similar material for them
 I will also use a similarity analysis technique. It involves a lot of complex mathematics. But the scikit-learn library has some great in-built functions 
 that will take care of most of the heavy lifting. I will explain how to use those functions and their job as we move forward with the exercise.
